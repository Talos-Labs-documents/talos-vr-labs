# METHODS.md — Reproducible Protocol

This protocol standardizes data so community results can be compared.

## Baseline (5 min seated, pre-session)
Record: time, HR, optional HRV, SpO₂, BP (if available), brief balance (Romberg 30s), sleep hours, caffeine in last 6h, mood (0–10), nausea (0–10), dissociation (0–10).

## Device Parameters
- Low, constant RPM (document target & measured)  
- Gentle visuals (no strobe/laser), low-volume audio  
- E-STOP within reach; operator present

## Exposure
- Session 1: ≤ 2:00 min → 10 min observation  
- Session 2: ≤ 4:00 min (≥24h later)  
- Session 3: ≤ 6:00 min  
- Continue gradual increases only if symptom-free

## Post (immediately + 10 min)
Repeat mood/nausea/dissociation scales; note any symptoms.

## Data Format (CSV headers)
Save a CSV with at least these columns:
