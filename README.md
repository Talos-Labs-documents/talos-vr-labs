# TALOS Labs ‚Äî 6DOF Immersion Starter (MVP)

**Ignition Node: 0 ‚Üí 1**  
This repository contains the starter kit for building and testing a modular, low-RPM, six-degrees-of-freedom (6DOF) immersion platform.  
It combines **rotational hardware + VR software + safety protocols + reproducible methods**.  
The goal: enable anyone to replicate, log, and contribute to a global open-science experiment.

## ‚ö° Quickstart

1. **Download release:** [talos-mvp.zip](./releases)  
   - Contains Unity + Unreal demo scenes, wiring diagrams, hardware specs, consent template, and session log CSV.  
2. **Assemble hardware:** follow `HARDWARE.md` (low-RPM motor, top clutch, emergency stop wiring).  
3. **Run demo:** open prefab scene in Unity or Unreal ‚Üí sync with motor controller ‚Üí test spin (max 2 min first run).  
4. **Log session:** use `session_log.csv` template, record baseline + exposure + post metrics.  
5. **Submit replication:** SHA256 your `session_log.csv` + ZIP, share via pull request or replicator portal.

## üõ° Safety First

- **Emergency Stop:** Big red E-STOP wired directly to motor controller. Must be tested before every session.  
- **Medical exclusions:** Do **not** participate if you have seizures, vestibular disorders, heart conditions, are pregnant, or have recent head trauma.  
- **Session limits:** Start with **2 min max exposure**. Increase only gradually across sessions if no adverse effects.  
- **Never run solo:** A session buddy must always be present with access to the E-STOP.  
- **Adverse events:** Stop immediately on nausea, dizziness, double vision, chest pain, confusion, or loss of consciousness. Seek medical attention.  

See [`SAFETY.md`](./SAFETY.md) for full checklist + printable consent form.

## üß™ Methods

We are treating this as **open community science**.  
Follow [`METHODS.md`](./METHODS.md) for a reproducible protocol:  

- **Baseline (pre):** HR, HRV, SpO‚ÇÇ, BP, balance test, subjective mood/perception.  
- **Session (during):** Log RPM, exposure duration, continuous HR/HRV if possible.  
- **Post (after):** Repeat baseline + subjective scales (nausea 0-10, dissociation 0-10, mood, clarity).  
- **Data format:** see `session_log.csv` for column schema.  

Always publish raw logs + SHA256 fingerprint. This preserves provenance and credibility.

## ü§ù Contribute

We welcome **replicators** who follow safety protocols.  
To contribute:  

1. Fork this repo.  
2. Upload your raw session logs (`.csv`) + SHA256 hash.  
3. Include short video (30‚Äì90s) of hardware + E-STOP test.  
4. Submit via pull request or contact through the verified replicator channel.  

Replications that meet safety + provenance requirements will be listed as **Verified Builds**.
