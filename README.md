# TALOS Labs ‚Äî 6DOF Immersion Starter (MVP)

**Ignition Node: 0 ‚Üí 1**  
This repository contains the starter kit for building and testing a modular, low-RPM, six-degrees-of-freedom (6DOF) immersion platform.  
It combines **rotational hardware + VR software + safety protocols + reproducible methods**.  
The goal: enable anyone to replicate, log, and contribute to a global open-science experiment.

## ‚ú® Fibonacci Mode (Natural Camouflage)
Fibonacci Mode layers rotation, visuals, audio, haptics, and timing using the same patterns found in nature
(1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8‚Ä¶ and œÜ ‚âà 1.618). The result is motion and pacing that feel ‚Äúorganic,‚Äù so the tech disappears into
the background. This repo ships a default config, demo code, and a **Proof Pack** (hashes + raw logs workflow) so
anyone can verify and reproduce results.

- Natural spin ramps (1‚Äì2‚Äì3‚Äì5‚Äì8 s), ‚ÄúGolden windows‚Äù at 34/55 RPM, micro-dither ¬±0.618 RPM.
- Visuals use phyllotaxis (sunflower spiral), golden-spiral overlays, frame gates at 34/55/89 frames.
- Audio/breath patterns on 1-1-2-3-5 and 3-5-8.
- Session blocks at 1/2/3/5/8 minutes.
- **Proof Pack**: SHA-256 hashing + timestamping workflow so results are tamper-evident and easy to replicate.

See `docs/FibonacciMode.md` and `config/fibonacci.yml`.

## ‚ö° Quickstart

1. **Download release:** [talos-mvp.zip](./releases)  
   - Contains Unity + Unreal demo scenes, wiring diagrams, hardware specs, consent template, and session log CSV.  
2. **Assemble hardware:** follow `HARDWARE.md` (low-RPM motor, top clutch, emergency stop wiring).  
3. **Run demo:** open prefab scene in Unity or Unreal ‚Üí sync with motor controller ‚Üí test spin (max 2 min first run).  
4. **Log session:** use `session_log.csv` template, record baseline + exposure + post metrics.  
5. **Submit replication:** SHA256 your `session_log.csv` + ZIP, share via pull request or replicator portal.

## üõ° Safety First

- **Emergency Stop:** Big red E-STOP wired directly to motor controller. Must be tested before every session.  
- **Medical exclusions:** Do **not** participate if you have seizures, vestibular disorders, heart conditions, are pregnant, or have recent head trauma.  
- **Session limits:** Start with **2 min max exposure**. Increase only gradually across sessions if no adverse effects.  
- **Never run solo:** A session buddy must always be present with access to the E-STOP.  
- **Adverse events:** Stop immediately on nausea, dizziness, double vision, chest pain, confusion, or loss of consciousness. Seek medical attention.  

See [`SAFETY.md`](./SAFETY.md) for full checklist + printable consent form.

## üß™ Methods

We are treating this as **open community science**.  
Follow [`METHODS.md`](./METHODS.md) for a reproducible protocol:  

- **Baseline (pre):** HR, HRV, SpO‚ÇÇ, BP, balance test, subjective mood/perception.  
- **Session (during):** Log RPM, exposure duration, continuous HR/HRV if possible.  
- **Post (after):** Repeat baseline + subjective scales (nausea 0-10, dissociation 0-10, mood, clarity).  
- **Data format:** see `session_log.csv` for column schema.  

Always publish raw logs + SHA256 fingerprint. This preserves provenance and credibility.

## ü§ù Contribute

We welcome **replicators** who follow safety protocols.  
To contribute:  

1. Fork this repo.  
2. Upload your raw session logs (`.csv`) + SHA256 hash.  
3. Include short video (30‚Äì90s) of hardware + E-STOP test.  
4. Submit via pull request or contact through the verified replicator channel.  

Replications that meet safety + provenance requirements will be listed as **Verified Builds**.
