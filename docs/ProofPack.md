# Proof Pack â€” Hashing, Timestamping, and Reproducibility

**Purpose:** Make your runs tamper-evident and easy for others to verify.

## What to capture (RAW)
- Unedited video of the rig (tripod/overhead if possible)
- Sensor streams: EEG (if used), IMU, RPM, system logs, timestamps (UTC)
- Configs: `config/fibonacci.yml`, app version, device IDs
- A simple text `RUN_NOTES.txt` (who, where, when, conditions)
