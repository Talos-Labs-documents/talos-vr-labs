## ✨ Fibonacci Mode (Natural Camouflage)
Fibonacci Mode layers rotation, visuals, audio, haptics, and timing using the same patterns found in nature
(1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8… and φ ≈ 1.618). The result is motion and pacing that feel “organic,” so the tech disappears into
the background. This repo ships a default config, demo code, and a **Proof Pack** (hashes + raw logs workflow) so
anyone can verify and reproduce results.

- Natural spin ramps (1–2–3–5–8 s), “Golden windows” at 34/55 RPM, micro-dither ±0.618 RPM.
- Visuals use phyllotaxis (sunflower spiral), golden-spiral overlays, frame gates at 34/55/89 frames.
- Audio/breath patterns on 1-1-2-3-5 and 3-5-8.
- Session blocks at 1/2/3/5/8 minutes.
- **Proof Pack**: SHA-256 hashing + timestamping workflow so results are tamper-evident and easy to replicate.
