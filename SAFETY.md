# SAFETY.md — TALOS Labs 6DOF Immersion Starter

**Read this entire page before building or using the platform.**  
This is experimental hardware. **Not a medical device. Use at your own risk.**

---

## 0) Non-Negotiables (TL;DR)
- **Big red E-STOP** wired to cut motor power immediately — test before every session.
- **Never run solo.** An observer must be within arm’s reach of the E-STOP.
- **Start short.** First exposure ≤ **2 minutes**, increase slowly across sessions.
- **No lasers / strobes** in MVP. Keep visuals gentle. No alcohol or drugs.
- **Stop immediately** if nausea, dizziness, vision changes, chest pain, confusion, or fainting.

---

## 1) Medical Exclusions
Do **not** participate if any apply without written medical clearance:
- History of seizures/epilepsy or syncopal episodes
- Vestibular disorders (e.g., Ménière’s), severe motion sickness
- Significant cardiovascular disease, arrhythmias, implanted devices
- Pregnancy
- Recent concussion/head trauma (past 3 months) or unresolved neurologic symptoms
- Uncontrolled migraines or severe visual disorders

---

## 2) Required Safety Features (MVP baseline)
- **E-STOP:** Latching mushroom switch rated for your voltage/current; wired inline to motor controller power (not just a software signal).
- **Top-plate clutch/lock:** Smooth stop/lock for entry/exit independent of the momentum plate.
- **Non-slip deck & seat restraint:** Textured surface; seat belt or harness for seated rigs.
- **Edge/guard:** Raised lip or rail to prevent foot slippage into moving parts.
- **Indicators:** Power-on and “rotating” LEDs visible to operator and participant.
- **Rated hardware:** Bearings, couplers, fasteners, and wiring sized for expected load + 2× safety factor.
- **Clear weight limit:** Document max occupant weight and torque margins in `HARDWARE.md`.

---

## 3) Environment & Setup
- Flat, open area; remove tripping hazards; no loose clothing, jewelry, or long hair near moving parts.
- Keep children and pets away from the device and the E-STOP.
- Operator and participant agree on **hand signals** and verbal stop phrase before starting.

---

## 4) Pre-Flight Checklists

### Operator
- [ ] Inspect frame, fasteners, belts/couplers, and bearings.
- [ ] Verify **E-STOP cuts power** instantly (test it!).
- [ ] Verify controller RPM limit is set to conservative baseline.
- [ ] Confirm visuals/audio are gentle (no strobes/lasers).
- [ ] Confirm emergency plan (phone available, address known).

### Participant
- [ ] Removed loose items; secured hair/clothing.
- [ ] Seated/standing position stable; restraints set if applicable.
- [ ] Aware of stop phrase/hand signal; understands they can stop anytime.
- [ ] **Self-check ok:** no dizziness, illness, or substances onboard.

---

## 5) Session Protocol & Limits (MVP)
**Week 1, conservative ramp (if symptom-free):**
- Session 1: **2 min max** → 10 min seated rest & observation
- Session 2: **4 min max** (≥24h later)
- Session 3: **6 min max**
- Subsequent: small increases only if prior sessions were symptom-free

**General rules**
- One exposure per day in MVP; do not “stack” sessions.
- Keep RPM **low and constant**; avoid sudden starts/stops.
- Operator keeps hand near E-STOP at all times.

---

## 6) Emergency Procedures
- **E-STOP immediately** on any adverse sign (participant or operator call).
- **Stabilize:** seat/lie participant, ensure airway, loosen restraints.
- **Monitor:** breathing, responsiveness; provide water; dim lights.
- **Escalate:** if chest pain, breathing difficulty, persistent confusion, seizure activity, or fainting → call emergency services.
- Record a brief incident note in your session log.

---

## 7) Post-Session Monitoring
For at least 30–60 minutes:
- Watch for delayed dizziness, headache, nausea, visual changes, unusual fatigue.
- **No driving or operating machinery** until participant feels fully normal.
- If new/worsening symptoms persist >24–48h, seek medical care and **pause** further sessions.

---

## 8) Maintenance
- Torque-mark fasteners; re-check after each of the first 5 sessions, then weekly.
- Inspect belts/couplers/bearings for heat, debris, or wear.
- Test **E-STOP** function before every session.
- Keep a maintenance log in `HARDWARE.md` or your own notebook.

---

## 9) Legal & Consent
- **Informed consent is mandatory
